# materials files EITHER need to contain the refractive index or the scattering properties of a single particle
# need three coloumns for the refractive index, wavelength, refractive index, and extinction coefficient
# need four coloumns for the scattering properties, wavelength, absorption coefficient (1/um), scattering coefficient (1/um), and asymmetry parameter
