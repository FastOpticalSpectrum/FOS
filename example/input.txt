# MC for Monte-Carlo or NN for neural network, must be in the first line

# hashtags comment a line out
# output defines the prefix for output files
Output: Test	# comments can also be inline next to input

# import any materials you will use as particles or mediums
# materials files need three coloumns, wavelength, refractive index, and extinction coefficient
